<p align="justify">
Next we provide all the steps that may be taken before running this experiment.
</p>


### Installation

<br/>

<p align="justify">
To run this experiment we will use an eclipse plugin called Organic. This plugin was tested in the following operational systems: Windows 7 and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
See below a step by step guide to install Organic into your environment:
</p>

<br/>
- Download and install JDK 1.7 (or higher) <br/>
- Download and install Eclipse Luna (or higher) <br/>
- Install Organic using Organic's <a href="http://wnoizumi.github.io/organic">update site</a> <br/>
- Install a software to record your screen. This is required because we need you analyze the use of Organic's features. (Suggestions: recordMyDesktop on Linux; webnaria on Windows) <br/>


### Downloading Workspace

<br/>

After installing eclipse and Organic, please dowload the following workspace: 
<a href="https://github.com/wnoizumi/experiment">OODT Workspace</a>


### Configuring Workspace

<br/>

1) Open eclipse <br/>
2) Go to File->Switch Workspace <br/>
3) Select the folder in which you downloaded the OODT Workspace (if you have downloaded a zip file, please extract to a dir) <br/>
4) Click on the Ok button <br/>
