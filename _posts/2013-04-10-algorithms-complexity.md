As you know, this year I started my masters course in computer science at PUC-RIO.
In my course one of the mandatory subjects is "Project and Analysis of Algorithms". 
Although this subject is very difficult for me, I am very interested in it.
Therefore I decided to talk about this subject, showing why I am so interested in it. 
Firstly, I will try to give a brief introduction about algorithms. 
Secondly, I will enumerate some reasons to study algorithms complexity.
And, to summarize, I will give some basic examples of algorithms complexity.

## What is an algorithm?

As you can see in several books and websites, an algorithm is a procedure to do something in a finite number of steps.
We use algorithms all the time, for example when we are driving, cooking, brushing teeth and so on.
In computer science the tasks performed by software systems are specified by algorithms. 
I won't spend much time in this topic. I wrote this topic just to contextualize and refresh your memory.
If you are reading this post I assume that you alread know something about algorithms. So let's to the point.

## What is algorithm complexity and why analyse it?

It is possible to analyse both correctness and complexity of an algorithm. 
As you can immagine, we analyse the correctness to check if the algorithm performs exactly what he intends to do.
It is an important subject, but I won't talk about it in this post. We will focus in the complexity of algorithms.

Complexity can be measured in several ways....
