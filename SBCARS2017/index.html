        <p class="text-justify">
            Software design comprises the overall organization of source code
            into macro structures like components and interfaces. Unfortunately,
            the maintainability of a system may be hampered due to
            the unintended introduction of software design problems. Due to
            such negative eect, design problems should be properly identied
            and removed to maintain the evolvability of long-lived systems. To
            identify design problems, developers can rely on the analysis of
            code smells, which are surface symptoms of design problems. Since
            each code smell is only a partial symptom of a design problem,
            researchers proposed a strategy that agglomerates inter-related
            code smells to reveal the full extension of design problems. Nevertheless,
            there is little empirical evidence about the practical use of
            agglomerated code smells for the identication of design problems.
            Therefore, in this paper we assessed a strategy called code smell
            agglomeration. This evaluation was based on quantitative and qualitative
            analysis. For the quantitative analysis, we performed an
            experiment with 11 professionals, comparing the use of agglomerations
            to the traditional use of code smells. On the other hand, in
            the qualitative analysis, we conducted a post-experiment survey
            and an evaluation based on the semiotic engineering. Results indicate
            that agglomerations can help developers to nd more design
            problems with fewer false positives. In addition, our qualitative
            analysis revealed that agglomerations can yield even better results.
            To make it possible, diculties faced by developers must be tackled.
            For instance, we observed that (1) the information provided by
            an agglomeration would be better used if it were synthesized into
            an unique and concise representation, (2) textual information of
            agglomerations should use a simpler terminology to be more easily
            understandable, and (3) developers would benet from the implementation
            of an algorithm capable of suggesting possible design
            problems according to the symptoms revealed by an agglomeration. </p>

        <p class="text-justify">
            We applied a quasi-experiment <a href="#shadish">(Shadish, 2001)</a>. A quasi-experiment is an experiment in which the unit/groups are not assigned
            to conditions randomly.
            The experiment was conducted individually with each participant.
            They had to perform the experiment in two steps with four
            tasks in each one. Both steps comprise the same set of task, the
            only diference between the steps was regarding the usage of agglomerations.

            We divided the participants
            into two groups. The 1st group would identify design problems
            using agglomerations in the 1st step and after they would identify
            design problems using a list of non-agglomerated code smells in
            2nd step. The second group of participants would make the
            identication inversely: using the non-agglomerated code smells
            in the 1st step and then using the agglomerations in the second
            step.

            A design problem is a design characteristic
            that negatively impacts quality attributes such as maintainability and performance <a href="#bar">(Bar, 1998</a>;

            macro structures like components, interfaces, hierarchies and other
            structures that are relevant for the design of the system. We considered 8 types of design problems in our
            study. We opted by selecting these design problems since they are often considered as critical.
            Following we present the design problems used in the study.

            We selected developers to identify design problems by sending a characterization

            Their answers were analyzed to determine which of them were eligible to participate

            By conducting the survey,
            we were able to gather the opinion of developers regarding the
            use of code smell agglomerations. What is reported in the survey may not be what actually happens in
            practice <a href="#easterbrook">(Easterbrook, 2008)</a>. Therefore, to obtain more reliable results, we conducted an
            evaluation using the Communicability Evaluation Method (CEM)
            <a href="#leitao">(Souza and Leitão, 2009)</a>. This method is based on the theory of Semiotic Engineering
            and is intended to find ruptures of communication when a user
            interacts with a system. In the context of this paper, system is the
            Organic tool and user is the software developer that uses code smell
            agglomerations to identify design problems.

        <p class="text-justify>">
            To apply CEM, we followed the steps and procedures recommended by <a href="#leitao">Souza and Leitão</a>. In this context, CEM
            can be applied being divided in five steps: (0) Preparation, (1) Tagging, (2) Interpretation, (3) Semiotic Profile
            and (4) Conclusion. Following we describe the 2 first steps.

        <h5>Participants Profile</h5>
        <p class="=text-justify">
            To this study, we selected participants that meet the following requirements:

            <li>At least 4 years of experience with software development</li>
            <li>Intermediary knowledge about software architecture</li>

        <p class="=text-justify">
            This profile is justified by the fact that Organic is part of a complex domain, which is not know by all the
            software developers (our target audience). Participants that have a minimal knowledge about the involved concepts have
            more chance revealing communicability problems when utilizing the tool.

            Based on this profile, we choose 3 participants, as described in Table III.

        <h5>Experiment Scenario</h5>

        <p class="text-justify>">
            Since Organic is designed to just perform the architectural problems identification, the experiment scenario is
            composed by just one task. During 30 minutes, the developer need to search for architectural problems in the
            source code of a given software project. In this task context, the software project selected was Apache OODT.
            For each problem found by the participant, the following informations should be provided:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Brief description about the problem</li>
                <li>Classes and methods that perform the source code problem </li>
                <li>Features of the tool that were helpful on the problem detection</li>
            </ul>

        <p class="text-justify>">
            During the identification task, besides tool access, the participant also could consult three documents:
            (1) Apache OODT documentation, (2) Reference about the basic concepts involved on the task and (3) Organic manual.
        </p>

        <br/>
        <h5>Ambient and Infrastructure</h5>
        To realize this study, we defined a ambient and infrastructure composed by a indivual room equipped with a notebook
        with the following configuration:

        <p>Hardware</p>
        <ul>
            <li>8 GB RAM</li>
            <li>Intel Core i5 2.7GHz Processor</li>
            <li>Built-in microphone</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Software</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Organic plugin</li>
            <li>Windows 10 operational system</li>
            <li>JDK 1.8</li>
            <li>Eclipse Luna IDE</li>
            <li>Rabbit plugin</li>
            <li>Screen capture system Active Presenter</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Eclipse Luna was chosen since Organic just works with this version. </p>


        <br/>
        <h5>Interview pre and post-experiment</h5>
        <p class="text-justify">
            With interviews pre-experiment, we collected participants profile information. The post-experiment questions
            were designed individually for each participant. The following questions were done to all participants:

            <ul>
        <li>Which were the main difficulties to realize the activity?</li>
        <li>Which tool features were most useful? </li>
    </ul>
        </p>

        <br/>
        <h5>Data collected</h5>
        <p>
            To realize the next steps, we collected the following informations:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Answers given during the interviews</li>
            <li>Audio and video recorded from the computer during the task</li>
            <li>Report given by Rabbit plugin</li>
            <li>Annotations done during the task</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Step 1 - Tagging</h4>
        <p class="text-align">
            In the previous step, the researcher watch the recording sessions of each participant and identifies passages
            that are indicative of breakdown in communication. Each passage is tagged with one of 13 specific utterances
            divided in three types: (1) Partial failures, (2) Temporary Failures and (3) Complete failures. Following we
            describe each tag.
        </p>

        <h5>
            <b>Partial Failures:</b>
        </h5>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Thanks, but no</b>: The user ignores some preferential intended affordance present in the application's
            interface and finds another way around task execution to achieve his goal</li>
            <li><b>I can do otherwise</b>: Typically, the user achieves his goal in a way that is not optimal, because
            he is not fully away of designer's deputy discourse</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>
            <b>Temporary Failures:</b>
        </h5>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Where am I?</b>: When the user is interpreting (and potentially using) signs in the wrong context
            of the application. </li>
            <li><b>Oops...</b>: The user perform some action but the outcome is not what he expected.</li>
            <li><b>I can't do it this way</b>: The user abandons a path of interaction (composed of many steps) because
            he thinks it is not leading him toward his current goal</li>
            <li><b>What happened?</b>: The user do not get feedback from the system and are apparently unable to assign
            meaning to the function's outcome</li>
            <li><b>Where is it?</b>: The user seems to be searching for a specific function but demonstrates difficulty
            in locating it.</li>
            <li><b>What's this?</b>: The user seems to be exploring the possibilities of interactions to gain more (or some)
            understangind of what a specific function achieves.</li>
            <li><b>Help!</b>: The user deliberately calls a help function, using menus, dragging question marks, or asking
            somebody for help (e.g. the observer or a colleague).</li>
            <li><b>Why doesn't it?</b>: The user expects some sort of outcome, but does not achieve it.</li>
            <li><b>What now?:</b> The user is clearly searching for a clue of what to do next and not searching for a specific
            function that hopes will achieve what he wants to do</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>
            <b>Complete Failures:</b>
        </h5>
        <ul>
            <li><b>I give up</b>: The user is unable to achieve the proposed goal, either because he does not know how to or
             because he does not have enough time, or will, or patience to do it</li>
            <li><b>Looks fine to me...</b>: The user achieve some result he believe is the expected one. At times he misinterprets
             feedback from the application and does not realize taht the result is not the expected one.</li>
        </ul>
