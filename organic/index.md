## Organic: tooling support for the synthesis of code anomalies

Organic was designed to help programmers in identifying design problems in the source code of Java systems, where design documentation is scare, incomplete or obsolete. Moreover, this tool can also be used by researchers to study the relationships of code-anomaly agglomerations (Oizumi et al. 2015) and software design degradation. The tool is implemented as a plug-in for the Eclipse platform. In this tool, a number of features collaborate with each other to satisfy the requirements (Chapter 3 of Oizumi 2015) for a synthesis technique. 

### Download

A prototype of organic is available for download and installation. The steps to install organic are the following:

- Download and install JDK 1.7 (or higher) <br/>
- Download and install Eclipse Luna (or higher) <br/>
- Open Eclipse <br/>
- Go to Help->Install New Software <br/>
- Add Organic's <a href="http://wnoizumi.github.io/organic/plugin">update site</a> <br/>
- Install Organic <br/>
